README for the v2.1 MATLAB C++ Math Library examples directory

This directory contains the code for the example programs described in
the MATLAB C++ Math Library documentation.

ex1.cpp     -- Creating Arrays and Array I/O
ex2.cpp     -- Calling Library Routines         
ex3.cpp     -- Passing Functions As Arguments   
ex4.cpp     -- Writing Simple Functions         
ex5.cpp     -- Handling Exceptions
ex6.cpp     -- Using File I/O Functions
ex7.cpp     -- Using load() and save()
ex8.cpp     -- Rewriting roots.m in C++

example9    -- Directory for Example 9: Using the MATLAB Compiler

release.txt -- Release notes for this version of the C++ Math Library

To build the examples, use the mbuild utility, located in the
$MATLAB/bin directory.  If you've never used mbuild before, you'll
need to run 

% mbuild -setup 

to set up mbuild correctly for your C++ compiler.  See

% mbuild -help

for more details on mbuild.

To build Example 9:
cd example9
mbuild -output ex9 *.cpp

Please also read the release notes (release.txt) in this directory and
the README and release notes in the extern/examples/cmath directory.
