The notation <MATLAB> refers to the root of your MATLAB installation.
On UNIX this corresponds to the value of the environment variable $MATLAB,
and on the PC to the value of the variable %MATLAB%.

For information about the MATLAB C++ Math Library, see the MATLAB C++
Math Library release notes in <MATLAB>/extern/examples/cppmath/release.txt.

MATLAB C MATH LIBRARY VERSION 2.1 INFORMATION

For help installing the MATLAB C Math Library, see the "Getting Ready"
chapter in the "MATLAB C Math Library User's Guide".

Version 2.1 of the library provides the following new features:

  * EVAL is supported for expressions which do not contain variables
  * INPUT is supported with the same restrictions as EVAL
  * Performance enhancements in the core numerical routines

The library does not yet support these MATLAB language features:

  * MATLAB objects
  * MATLAB R12 Java Objects


The "MATLAB C Math Library User's Guide" is available in PDF format
through the Help Desk. The "MATLAB C Math Library Reference", which
documents individual library functions, is available through the
Help Desk if you are a MATLAB user or through <MATLAB>/help/mathlib.html
if you are a stand-alone customer.


NOTE: You must recompile your existing Version 2.0 hand-written source
code before using it with Version 2.1.  Additionally, any M-files
which were compiled with Version 2.0 of the MATLAB Compiler must be
recompiled with Version 2.1 of the MATLAB Compiler before using them
with the Version 2.1 libraries.  If you do not recompile your program,
it will produce a runtime error or crash.

PC-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

- We support these C/C++ compilers:
    1. Microsoft Visual C/C++, Versions 5.0 and 6.0
    2. Borland C/C++, Versions 5.0 and 5.02 (5.2)
    3. Borland C++ Builder Versions 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0
    4. LCC version 2.4
  WATCOM C/C++ compilers are no longer supported.

- You must make sure that <MATLAB>\bin is on your path
  in order to run your standalone executables. The installation program
  modifies your path to contain <MATLAB>\bin, so you shouldn't have to
  do this manually. If your programs won't run because they can't find
  libmmfile.dll or libmatlb.dll, your path may not be set correctly.
