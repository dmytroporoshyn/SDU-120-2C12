README for the v1.2 MATLAB C Math Library examples directory

This directory contains the code for the example programs described in
the MATLAB C Math Library documentation.

ex1.c -- Creating and Printing Arrays
ex2.c -- Writing Simple Functions
ex3.c -- Calling Library Routines
ex4.c -- Handling Errors
ex5.c -- Saving and Loading Data
ex6.c -- Passing Functions as Arguments

To build the examples, use the mbuild utility, located in the
$MATLAB/bin directory.  If you've never used mbuild before, you'll
need to run 

% mbuild -setup

to set up mbuild correctly for your C compiler. See 

% mbuild -help

for more details on mbuild.
