The notation <MATLAB> refers to the root of your MATLAB installation.
On UNIX this corresponds to the directory that was chosen in the MATLAB
installation program, and on the PC to the value of the environmental 
variable %MATLAB%. You can also find the location of <MATLAB> by calling 
'matlabroot' from inside of MATLAB.

For information about the MATLAB C Math Library, see the MATLAB C
Math Library release notes in <MATLAB>/extern/examples/cmath/release.txt.

For information about the MATLAB C++ Math Library, see the MATLAB C++
Math Library release notes in <MATLAB>/extern/examples/cppmath/release.txt.

For information about the MATLAB Compiler, see the MATLAB Compiler release 
notes in <MATLAB>/toolbox/compiler/Readme.m.

MATLAB C/C++ GRAPHICS LIBRARY VERSION 2.1 INFORMATION

For help installing the MATLAB C/C++ Graphics Library, see Chapter 1
in the "MATLAB C/C++ Graphics Library User's Guide".

Version 2.1 of the library provides the following features:

  * uicontrols for GUIs
  * 2D and 3D graphical primitives
  * Printing
  * OpenGL
  * an improved version of mbuild
    The new version automatically copies any files needed at runtime
    for applications into a directory, called bin, located in the same
    directory as your generated application.  You will need to
    redistribute this directory with your application.

The library does not yet support these MATLAB graphics features:

  * MATLAB plot annotation tools (Scribe)
  * MATLAB R12 Java Objects

The "MATLAB C/C++ Graphics Library User's Guide" is available in PDF
and HTML formats through the Help Desk.

PC-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

- We support these C/C++ compilers:
    1. Microsoft Visual C/C++, Versions 5.0, and 6.0
    2. Borland C/C++, Versions 5.0 and 5.02 (5.2)
    3. Borland C++ Builder Versions 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0
    4. LCC version 2.4

- You must make sure that <MATLAB>\bin is on your path
  in order to run your standalone executables. The installation program
  modifies your path to contain <MATLAB>\bin, so you shouldn't have to
  do this manually. If your programs won't run because they can't find
  sgl.dll, libmwsglm.dll, libmmfile.dll or libmatlb.dll, your path may 
  not be set correctly.

- Some installers incorrectly replace mfc42.dll on Windows 98 machines 
  with older versions. This can cause the Graphics Library to behave
  poorly on these machines. If you are seeing spurious crashes
  try replacing the system mfc42.dll with either your Windows 98
  version or the one that is installed in bin for MATLAB.

HP/UX-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

When building a C application that uses the Graphics Library, you must
use aCC to link the executable.  In addition, if the main() function of
the C application was not generated by the MATLAB compiler, you must
make a call to the function _main() before any calls to the Graphics Library.
This is not required if the main program is a CPP application.
