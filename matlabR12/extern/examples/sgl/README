README for the v2.1 MATLAB C/C++ Graphics Library examples directory

This directory contains the code for the example programs described in
the MATLAB C/C++ Graphics Library documentation.

flames.m    -- An m-file that generates an animation of an image
flames.mat  -- A mat-file that contains an image of the MathWorks logo 
release.txt -- Release notes for this release of the C/C++ Graphics Library.

To compile the example, type from the MATLAB prompt:

% mcc -B sgl flames.m

To build the examples the mbuild utility, located in the
$MATLAB/bin directory, will be invoked.  If you've never used mbuild 
before, you'll need to run 

% mbuild -setup

to set up mbuild correctly for your C/C++ compiler. See 

% mbuild -help

for more details on mbuild.
